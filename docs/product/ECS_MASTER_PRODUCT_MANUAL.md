# ECS Master Product Manual

**Type:** Master product documentation. **No code/UI/DB changes.** **Grounding:** route registrars, module engines, `docs/product_manual/*`, `docs/AUDIT/*`. This manual is the **single entry point** to every ECS screen; deep per-screen detail (inputs/actions/exports) lives in [`docs/product/PRODUCT_MANUAL_ECS_SCREEN_CATALOG.md`](../product/PRODUCT_MANUAL_ECS_SCREEN_CATALOG.md) and screenshots in [`docs/product/screenshots/`](screenshots) — cross-referenced here to avoid duplication.

> **Canonical facts:** 15 frameworks · 305 controls · 702 evidence · 12 connectors · 9 RBAC roles · ~79 screens / 66 screenshots across 7 nav groups. (Demo seeds larger rounded datasets.)

**Per-screen attributes** (Purpose · Navigation · Persona · Business Value · Inputs · Outputs · KPIs · Drilldowns · Reports · Dependencies · Data Sources · APIs · Workflow Participation · Audit/Compliance/Executive Relevance) are tabulated below; the cross-referenced [Feature Inventory](../archive/ECS_PRODUCT_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md) carries Inputs/Outputs/Data/Drilldowns and the [Screen Catalog](../archive/AUDIT_ECS_SCREEN_CATALOG.md) carries Route/Dependencies/Doc/Screenshot.

## How to read this manual

Each screen row: **Screen — Route — Persona — Business value — KPIs — Workflow role — A/C/E relevance** (A=Audit, C=Compliance, E=Executive). Full Inputs/Outputs/Drilldowns/Reports/Dependencies/Data/APIs are in the linked AUDIT + product_manual docs (same screen names), keeping this manual navigable and non-duplicative.
